# TowerDefense2D.
A simple tower defense. 

My aim for this project was to create scripts that could be used on multiple objects(enemies, towers, etc).

Play with mouse. Slide cursor to the edge of the screen to move the camera. 

Pencil Harpoon launcher cost 60.

Marble catapult costs 80.

Lego obstacles cost 150.

Balance is still an issue, start with 2 pencil harpoon launchers and you will be good.
